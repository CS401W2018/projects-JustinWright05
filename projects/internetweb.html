    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>A global network of connected computers that lets people share information and access websites. Allows you to send emails, use social media, and watch videos from anywhere as long as you are connected to the Internet.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>Short for World Wide Web, Web is the list of websites and Web pages that are on the internet. It uses browsers like Safari and Google Chrome to show text, images, videos, etc. Web runs on a system of links called hyperlinks that connect Webpages. This allows you to easily navigate between them.</p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The Internet is a physical network of devices around the world that are all connected to each other. The Web is a type of service that can accessed through the internet using a web browser. The difference is that the Internet is the global network and the Web is one of the many things that can be accessed through the internet.</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII and Unicode are both different ways to represent text on computers. ASCII is limited to 128 characters, mainly used for english letters, numbers, and basic symbols like @, !, etc. ASCII uses 1 byte per character and cannot handle characters from any other languages besides english. Unicode represents thousands of characters, symbols, and emojis from almost any language. Unicode is more flexible and uses different formats like UTF-8 which uses 1-4 bytes per character. Unicode is more versatile than ASCII and is the standard for representing text on computers. </p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 is a way to encode characters from the Unicode character set. It is the main way to represent text on computers because it can represent any character in the world. UTF-8 uses 1-4 bytes each character, is flexible and efficent, and is backwards compatible with ASCII.</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>URL is the address used to access things like websites, files, or services on the internet. Similar to an address for a house, but for resources on the Web.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>Domain Name is a websites readable address. Instead of knowing a series of numbers known as an IP Address, you can enter a Domain Name instead to access the website. An example would be www.example.com</p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP is a protocol used to transmit data through the internet. Acts as a set of rules that lets Web browsers and servers communicate. When a URL is entered in a Web browser, it sends an HTTP request to the server. The server then gives the user the requested Web page or resource.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data that is exchanged from the browser and server to protect it from being tampered.</p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>IP Address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to each device connected to a network. Makes communicating with other devices possible. IPv4 is the most common format consisting of 4 set of numbers ranging from 0 to 255. IPv6 is a newer format created due to the limited space of IPv4. It has eight groups of numbers and letters so it can house more devices. A Public IP Address is used to identify your network on the internet. A private IP Address is used on a local network like your home network and is not shown on the internet. </p>
