    <h1>Konichiwa, My Name is Lebron James</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello, my name is Lebron James, aka Lebonbon, aka
         King James, aka LeKing, aka lead role of Space Jam:
          A New Legacy. Im 39 years old, and I am the greatest actor of all time.
         I am mostly known for my work in Space Jam, as well as Trainwreck.
         Oh and I do like to play a little bit of basketball on my free time.
          Some people say im not too bad but I don't know. Basketball is just a hobby. 
          My real passion is Badminton. Badminton is arguably the hardest sport of all 
          time and I am striving to be the greatest of all time.</p>
          <h2>Here is a list of things I've said that has 
            truly inspired the world</h2>
            <ol type="A">
                <li><q>I wish I could just, like, walk into
                     a movie theater and sit down and go to 
                     the concession stand and eat popcorn.</q></li>
                <li><q>Leave me alone! I have a leg cramp!</q></li>
                <li><q>Steph Curry? Never heard of her.</q></li>
                <li><q>Sometimes your best effort just isn't good enough</q></li>
                <li><q>My hairline is gone! Please help me find it.</q></li>
            </ol>
    <h2>Martin Luther King Jr. once said,</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <em>Let no man pull you low enough to hate him.</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This has got to be one of my favorite quotes in the history of the entire world.
        This shows that you can't let the hate get to you. 
        Badminton is a very toxic sport and involves lots of trash talking and hate towards one another.
