        <h2 class="darkblue">What Is Brawl Stars?</h2>
        <p class="blue">Brawl Stars is the greatest game of all time. The game is simple.
            You play as a character of your choice. Each character has a unique 
            set of skills that sets it apart from another character. After you 
            choose your character, you compete against other players in a battle 
            to the death and fight until one person comes out on top.
        </p>
        <h2 class="darkblue">My Favorite Character</h2>
        <p class="blue">I like a lot of characters in Brawl Stars but I gotta say my all time 
            favorite character is Buzz. Buzz is a close range Brawler that 
            breathes fire at the target. His super shoots a projectile at the 
            opponent and stuns them leaving room for Buzz to do his thing. I love 
            Buzz because of how beautful and cute he is. He makes me smile.</p>
