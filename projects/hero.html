        <p>
            El Primo is my hero. El Primo comes from the far away 
            land of Mexico.The english translation for El Primo 
            is The Cousin. He is my hero beacause of his huge muscles. 
            They are so big and he looks beautiful with his shirt off.
            My favorite thing about El Primo is when I am in grave danger,
            He always comes out of the sky and shouts EL PRIMO as he saves 
            me in style.
