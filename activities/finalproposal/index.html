            <li>Tyler, The Creator and about his different albums</li>
            <li>I chose to do this topic because he is one of my favorite song artist. He also has lots of different things about him that I could use to make the website more interesting. He has many different albums which will be useful for the final.</li>
            <li>The Home page will be an about me for Tyler, The Creator with a navigation that goes to the other five pages. The other five pages will have facts and information about each of his albums. Every page will be a different album and it will dive into each album, understanding them better, and my personal opinion on the album. The one with the table will be a list of the songs in the album ranked.</li>
            <li>The information going into the form will be about the album such as which album is your favorite, text box to write why the album is your favorite, first and last name, and an email. The data on my table will be a list of the songs in the album that is my personal ranking.</li>
            <li>I will use my own pictures that I have taken as well as non copyrighted pictures on the internet. references I plan on using are captions describing what the image is and who or where it came from.</li>
            <li>I have acknowledged the warnings below and I agree to the terms.</li>
