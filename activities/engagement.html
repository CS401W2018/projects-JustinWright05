        <h2>What goes in a Header?</h2>
        <p>Header has the Webpages title, and sometimes can have 
            the navigation in it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? 
            Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain 
            links to another website?</h2>
        <p>Links to your webpages go into the Nav. The Nav 
            can go into the header but it doesn't have to. 
            It depends on what you want for your webpage. 
            Nav doesn't have links to other websites. Only 
            webpages on your own website.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What Goes in Main?</h2>
        <p>Main is where all the important information for 
            the webpage goes. Main is what changes when using 
            the Navigation.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What Goes in the Footer?</h2>
        <p>Footer contains all the extra information that is 
            located at the bottom of the webpage. Copyright, 
            privacy notice, legal notices, cookie preferences,
