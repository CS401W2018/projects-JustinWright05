                    <li>It was released under XL Recordings, an independent British label.</li>
                    <li>The album acts as a continuation of the therapy session narrative started in Tyler's 2009 mixtape Bastard, with a fictional therapist named Dr. TC guiding the storyline.</li>
                    <li>The album faced criticism for its dark, violent, and explicit themes, though Tyler stated much of it was fictional and reflective of his creative mind.</li>
                    <li>Notable tracks include "Yonkers," which gained significant attention for its provocative music video and helped launch Tyler into mainstream recognition.</li>

                        Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)
                        On my waist, there's a black lock (black lock)
                        New girl moved on the block (on the block)
                        She been plottin' on my heart, nonstop (heart, nonstop)
                        <br> <br>
                        Last night I slept over hers (over hers)
                        During rest, I overheard (I overheard)
                        A sound sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
                        Rolled off the bed then shot back, paow-paow
                        Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
                        Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
                        A real figure with the blade and the mask
                        Got those gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks
                        <br> <br>
                        Now she's tryna patch me up, but
                        Girl, I was just tryna show some love
                        If that's your ex, you should probably own a whistle
                        But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
                        <br> <br>
                        The blinds wide open so he can
                        See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
                        Fresh body, fresh out the shower
                        Uh, and you sit and think after hours
                        Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
                        You're sleeping alone in bed
                        But check your window (swag), he's at your window
                        <br> <br>
                        The night light's off, turnin' whispers to bites
                        I'm a down-to-earth guy with intentions that might
                        Be good, but be down-to-earth quicker if you cross me tonight
                        But I'd be the happiest if you decide to chill tonight
                        <br> <br>
                        We can relax and I can act like I don't want more
                        You can tell me all your problems like I really adore
                        But I care 'cause you're the one that I want
                        Don't wanna seem like a guy who pretends he's not caught
                        <br> <br>
                        See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
                        But in the back of my mind, I'm writing songs about we
                        We, as including I and yourself, making three
                        Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me (yeah)
                        <br> <br>
                        You're a pretty star in the top three
                        Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
                        Meet me by the lake around ten and skinny dippin', and then
                        We can begin the pretend game, I want to be Finn from Adventure Time
                        <br> <br>
                        The blinds wide open so he can
                        See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
                        Fresh body, fresh out the shower
                        And you sit and think after hours
                        Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
