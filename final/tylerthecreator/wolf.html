                    <p class="lyrics">
                        I never would've thought that
                        Feelings could get thrown in the air
                        'Cause I accidentally caught that
                        I need some new boxing gloves, stuff got hectic whenever I fought back
                        For now, I'mma just
                        Sit in this corner and watch you
                        Fight for my heart while I'm popping popcorn
                        I hear "emotions" and I mock 'em
                        Like, "What? I'm supposed to care?"
                        And "I'mma stay a while another day," what?
                        You keep on saying that you're leaving, oh yeah
                        <br> <br>
                        And why don't you say it to my face? (To my face)
                        You make me feel so misplaced
                        And every time I think I'm winning (winning)
                        You find a way to mess up my living space (living space)
                        <br> <br>
                        'Cause I hate you, but I love you, oh
                        I hate you, but I love you, oh
                        I hate you, but I love you, oh
                        I hate you, but I love you, oh
                        And I don't want to
                        But I can't stop
                        It's like
                        I hate you, but I love you, oh
                        I hate you, but I love you, oh
                        I hate you, but I love you, oh
                        I hate you
                        <br> <br>
                        You want to talk it out? Fine
                        I'll settle down, but you know how I get when I'm alone
                        I can't stop thinking about how much I hate
                        You
                        <br> <br>
                        But I love you, I
                        I hate you, but I love you
                        I can't stand the way you do the things you do
                        But I still want you around
                        <br> <br>
                        You're my everything and nothing all in one
                        I wish I could explain, but I'm feeling kinda numb
                        And even when you're gone, I'm just chasing after crumbs
                        It's the same game every day, I'm just dumb
                    </p>
