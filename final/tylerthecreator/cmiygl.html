                        [Intro]
                        No, no, no, no, no, no, listen, listen
                        (Call me when you get lost, lost)
                        The driver will drop you off
                        Alright, it's warm
                        (Call me when you get lost, lost)
                        The waterfall is beautiful
                        I don't know, just say something, make it up
                        <br><br>
                        [Verse 1]
                        You and I, we fell in love
                        I didn't see the signs, didn't know what it was
                        But God must've outdone Himself when He made you
                        The cosmos' only mistake was what they named you
                        They should've called you sugar—you're so sweet
                        Yes, they should've called you sugar
                        Because you're so sweet to me
                        Oh, they should've called you sugar
                        Because, baby, you're the sweetest thing I've ever known
                        <br><br>
                        [Chorus]
                        Even if you left me stranded
                        My feelings wouldn't change at all
                        You know how I feel about you
                        Infinite, the love I have for you
                        Nothing could ever dent it
                        <br><br>
                        [Bridge]
                        Darling, you're the wind beneath my wings
                        My heart beats faster every time I see you
                        It's something I can't control
                        If I compared you, the sun is just a stand-in
                        Your smile lights up a planet
                        <br><br>
                        [Outro]
                        They should've called you sugar
                        Because you're so sweet
                        Yes, they should've called you sugar
                        Because you're so sweet to me
                        And you're the sweetest, sweetest thing
                        The way you look, the way you smell
                        You're so, so good
                        <br><br>
                        [Verse 2]
                        What makes you think I'm not in love?
                        How could you know what's best for us?
                        Why am I here standing alone?
                        I thought you wanted to dance
                        <br><br>
                        [Bridge 2]
                        It's all about timing, yeah
                        I didn't mean to lead you on
                        But my energy belongs to you
                        I want you so much, but not too fast
                        It's not your fault—we can't pretend
                        <br><br>
                        [Rap Section]
                        I wish we never met, I wish we didn't connect
                        Sometimes signals cross, and it's hard to reflect
                        But I wanted you to choose me with your voice
                        I know you're with him, but I'm still lost in the choice
                        I stay busy, don't want to think about the past
                        But I thought you wanted to dance
                        <br><br>
                        [Final Chorus]
                        I wish we had better timing
                        I'll save a dance just for you
                        Don't forget about me
                        I'll save a dance just for you
                    </p>
