                    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                    <p class="lyrics">
                        La-la-la-la-la-la-la
                        Uh
                        Big dreams, big dreams, what you got, huh?
                        You got your crew, you got your squad?
                        Don't let 'em know you regret how you got here
                        A good kid, a fine home, mom and dad in the picture
                        A little middle-class money, every holiday legit
                        Family trips, Ivy-bound, but one day, hit a switch
                        You didn't want to be seen as weak
                        But none of those tattoos can hide the fact that you're struggling
                        You're not a tough guy, you were in drama club, you're an actor
                        But now you're getting validation from those who are confused
                        Now you're facing consequences for things you did to prove something
                        <br><br>
                        [Chorus]
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you take off that mask
                        <br><br>
                        [Verse 1]
                        Preacher man, preacher man, preach
                        You make people think you have something to teach
                        But you're not being truthful
                        Big money from your job, but what are you really buying?
                        Not too fond of certain things, don't deny it
                        Since a kid, you knew something was off
                        Had you thinking you weren't good enough, so you covered it up
                        Had to hide how you lived, what you really enjoyed
                        So you got a wife, got kids, but you keep secrets inside
                        Tired of the shame, tired of the pain
                        Scared of being seen, hiding from your truth
                        You want to be free, to shine bright, but you hide in the shadows
                        Let's talk about it
                        <br><br>
                        [Chorus]
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you take off that mask
                        <br><br>
                        [Verse 2]
                        Big house on the hills
                        Big cars in the garage
                        Three kids in your arms
                        Your partner just made another million
                        You want your life back, just to feel more at peace
                        Tired of staying home, feeling like you've lost who you are
                        Body's changed, your spirit feels lost
                        You dream of a time when you had more freedom
                        But you feel stuck, playing roles to meet expectations
                        You fantasize about your dreams, but can't find time to pursue them
                        Let's talk about it
                        <br><br>
                        [Chorus]
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you take off that mask
                        <br><br>
                        [Bridge]
                        Be real with yourself, you don't need to hide
                        No need to put on a mask or pretend
                        You don't have to lie to make it
                        Physical and emotional pain is real
                        Stop blaming everyone else and start healing
                        Take a step back, breathe, and find your peace
                        You don't have to be afraid of facing the truth
                        <br><br>
                        [Verse 3]
                        Stop running from who you are
                        Stop hiding from the truth
                        Tell your family what's been going on
                        Tell your spirit why you've been feeling down
                        You can't keep pushing others away
                        You can't keep acting like you've got it all figured out
                        Boy, you need therapy, but you're too afraid to seek it
                        The respect you want won't come until you're honest
                        You deserve to feel the love you're missing
                        <br><br>
                        [Chorus]
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you find yourself
                        And I hope you take off that mask
