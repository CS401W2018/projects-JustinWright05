                    <p class="lyrics">
                        Aw, nah
                        Boy, don't cut that wood
                        Found out his flowers don't smell that good
                        But if they smell real good to him
                        Then he don't need anybody else's nose to win
                        <br><br>
                        Look, I am a leader
                        No, I don't pray to society
                        All you other people wear camouflage
                        I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
                        <br><br>
                        What weak people see me?
                        Young creators will scream with me
                        You don't have the drive to even beep-beep
                        They wanna talk from the back seat
                        <br><br>
                        Come and light my fire, I'll show you the way
                        I'm the pilot, yeah
                        And I decide when we gon' take off
                        Let's get it
                        <br><br>
                        Tie the knot
                        Kick the chair
                        Up in the air
                        It's Cherry Bomb
                        <br><br>
                        You all want something, then come get it
                        You all want something, but I don't want conflict
                        <br><br>
                        Just take me to the starting point
                        I don't have time for your watch, man
                        I keep moving forward, leaving no trace
                        <br><br>
                        Come and light my fire, I'll show you the way
                        I'm the pilot, yeah
                        And I decide when we gon' take off
                        Let's get it
                        <br><br>
                        Tie the knot
                        Kick the chair
                        Up in the air
                        It's Cherry Bomb
                        <br><br>
                        They're like "this that Cherry Bomb"
                        I'm a firecracker, and I'm ready to blow
                        You fire me up, I lose control
                        <br><br>
